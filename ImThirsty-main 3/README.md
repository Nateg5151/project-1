# ImThirsty

## Description

This app will guide any avid beer drinker or any curious beer enthusiast search for breweries of many types in any state. The finder can lead to discovering new brewries and even types of beer that we do not know about. This application will solve curious beer-seeking minds that like to travel, or even stay at home to find a brewery in the user's state!

## Installation

To start off the building of this application, we had to breakdown what needed to be done in order to have a simple layout by wireframing method. After, we had to find server APIs that will deliver data into our application so it will run in the manner of finding breweries. A map was added as a guide for anyone seeking certain breweries. A title and links were added at the top of the page, then footer information was pulled in. Tiles, or cards, were added to store map, returned brewery information, and ended up incorporating the footer into a tile at the bottom for a neater look. The APIs were incorporated so that it will connect to the layout of the application. A for loop was utilized to return breweries by state. The map will search by state entered in the searchbar. Bulma CSS was incorporated for the design of the application page.

## Usage

The user can search for breweries by state. The user will enter the state in the search bar which will return a list of breweries to the right column and will pull the searched state in the map in the left column. The application will display a list of seven breweries in the state. The links at the top will provide favorite/popular breweries among the users. User will be able to input email information if he or she would like to hear about updated popular breweries. Pictures will be provided at the top link as well of breweries across the state. Contact bar will be at the bottom regarding functionality of the application.
